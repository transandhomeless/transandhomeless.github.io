    <h1>California</h1>

    <p>Consider applying to <a href="https://www.coveredca.com">Medi-Cal</a> if one of these apply to you:</p>
    <p>-You earn less than $18,755 before taxes and other deductions</p>
    <p>-You are 65 or older</p>
    <p>-You are blind or disabled</p>
    <p>-You are under the age of 21</p>
    <p>-You are pregnant</p>
    <p>Why apply to Medi-Cal? It will 100% cover all of your medical visits, including
        primary care visits, mental health, any bloodwork, HRT, and all trans surgeries.
    </p>
    <p>If you have a bank balance of $2,001 or less and make less than $17,667/year before taxes, consider
        applying for <a href="https://www.getcalfresh.org/?source=dssfood">SNAP benefits</a> (money for food)
    </p>
    <p>Lastly, if you have no income, you can apply to General Relief (this is cash you will receive each month).
        To apply for General Relief, you should look up "general relief [county you live in]"
    </p>
    <p>Note: any place that shows up here either mention being trans friendly on the site or 
        I have personally called or emailed to verify that they allow
        trans individuals to be housed with whatever gender they desire to be housed with.
